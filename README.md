# CoPoL
## Introduction
This project was cancelled before starting because of
[Kaa Project](http://kaaproject.org). Kaa project implements
our idea completely.
## Kaa Application Development [Delete Notification]
For providing PoC (Proof of Concept) we do following
things from [here](http://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Your+first+Kaa+application):

1. Adding application
2. Creating notification schema
3. Generating SDK
4. Sample client application
5. Creating notification topic

At the end we have application that can delete files form client
based on user request :).
