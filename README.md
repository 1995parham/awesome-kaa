# CoPoL aka Kaa101
## Introduction
This project was cancelled before starting because of
[Kaa Project](http://kaaproject.org). Kaa project implements
our idea completely.

## Kaa Application Development [Boot Animation Notification]
For providing PoC (Proof of Concept) we do following
things from [here](http://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Your+first+Kaa+application):

1. Adding application
2. Creating notification schema
3. Generating SDK
4. Creating our sample client application
5. Creating notification topic
6. Send notification to the device and have fun

At the end we have application that
can play android boot animation on rooted android device form client with
Android Debug Bridge
based on user request and with his specified interval :).
